# Contact Manager
A simple contact manager to manage CRUD operations of contacts.
I have setup the JSON-server for our fake APIs and use React Axios package to perform HTTP Requests in react.
We will follow the RESTful API convention (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and see how easily we do CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE operations on our contacts resource.
## Functionalities
* Create Contact
* Read Contacts
* Update Contact
* Delete Contact
* Save Contacts in the server
* Delete all Contacts
